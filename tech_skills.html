            <h3>Python:</h3>
            <p>
                Python was the first programming language that I learned, starting with the basics like data types, working with loops, developing functions, and handling errors. Then
                I moved onto more detailed processes like file handling, regular expressions, and Object Oriented Programming (aka: OOP) before learning how to integrate a database.
            </p>
            <h3>SQL:</h3>
            <p>
                SQL and database management was fun to learn and implement, integrating databases into application operations using SQL. The simplicity of SQL made it interesting
                to me, and I enjoyed using SQLAlchemy to simplify functions even more. 
            </p>
            <h3>HTML:</h3>
            <p>
                Like many people around my age, I had my first interactions with HTML in the days of Myspace where I used HTML to modify the look of my Myspace page. After learning 
                more about HTML at Coding Temple, I now understand and know how to use HTML to build web pages and web sites, formatting the pages to be user friendly and easily readable.
            </p>
            <h3>CSS:</h3>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS for short, was a nice addition to the tools and abilities that I've learned in coding. Learning how to turn basic HTML documents and web
                pages into interactive, responsive, and beautifully designed websites has been not only interesting but a lot of fun. Using classes and psuedo-classes to assign styling 
                effects to different sections of a webpage, and using animations to enhance the style of a webpage. I look forward to using this skills more in the future of my coding
                journey.

            <h3>Reflecting on What I've Learned:</h3>
            <p>
                I've learned a lot about programming and writing code for different uses and functions. From creating To-Do List applications to creating System Management 
                applications for a Fitness Center or Library, utlizing databases to hold and manage data using tables and objects, and creating web forms and integrated web pages
                with delicate and interactive styling, I am now confident in my ability to create a fully functional system using the different programming languages I have learned. I look forward to using all of the
                skills and coding abilities that I've obtained, and I will continue on this journey of education in coding.
