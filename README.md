# **Hello World**

This repository is for my Personal Portfolio Mini Project.

Project Status: Completed

The files contained in this repository were written and designed to create a website about myself, Kyle Jones, and all the projects I've done 
during my time learning how to code at Coding Temple. It includes an account of the programming languages I've learned, the skills and abilities 
in coding that I've obtained, and the projects I created. You can find my contact information on the contact page, learn more about me on the 
about me page, get a look at some code snippets and descriptions of the projects I worked on, and get details about the technical skills I've obtained during my education at Coding Temple. 

Each page has a navigation system setup to get to any of the other pages. There are also links provided to the repositories where the projects completed are stored. 

Update:
A new file was added called 'styles.css' which contains CSS styling for all the pages included in this project. Every page has its own section 
in the css file, and every single section of every page has styling applied. Some elements include hover effects, animations, and typography applied. The footer on any page with enough content to require even the smallest amount of scrolling was changed to be a 2nd nav bar for ease of use and movement between pages. Lastly, a contact form was added to the contact me page.

Please enjoy!
