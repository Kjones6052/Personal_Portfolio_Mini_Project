# **Hello World**

This repository is for my Personal Portfolio Mini Project.

Project Status: Completed

The files contained in this repository were written and designed to create a website about myself, Kyle Jones, and all the projects I've done during my time learning how to code at Coding Temple. It includes an account of the programming languages I've learned, the skills and abilities in coding that I've obtained, and the projects I created. You can find my contact information on the contact page, learn more about me on the about me page, get a look at some code snippets and descriptions of the projects I worked on, and details the technical skills I've obtained during my education at Coding Temple.
