                My name is Kyle Jones, and I've been a real estate agent for the last 7 years, but never really found that industry to be interesting or enjoyable. I have had a long standing
                interest in learning how to code, and in August of 2024 I enrolled with Coding Temple to begin my journey into coding. At Coding Temple I've learned
                how to use programming languages like Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS to build applications, databases, and websites. The journey has been a lot of fun but also 
                challenging, and I look forward to doing more coding projects and working with the skills and abilities that I've obtained throughout my education.
