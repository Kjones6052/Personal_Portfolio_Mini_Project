            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Southern California, and after my parents divorced when I was young I spent a few weeks a year visiting my mom in Connecticut. While 
                growing up I really enjoyed playing soccer, and I played soccer until an incident occurred when I was 17. The incident was almost losing my right thumb in a 
                landscaping accident, where a landscaper was trimming a bush and as I tried to walk around him he turned towards me and clipped my hand with the trimmer cutting 
                thumb and severing a tendon. After high school I had several different jobs which lead me to selling real estate, and eventually starting my journey into coding.
            </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I never graduated from high school, in fact after dropping out of a Los Osos High School in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, CA I enrolled in a self study program called
                Options For Youth. I also got dropped from Options For Youth after a few months, and in 2009 I got my GED from Chaffey Adult School in Ontario, CA. After obtaining the 
                GED I attended Chaffey Community College in Rancho Cucamonga for a little under 2 years before I quit attending and decided to work full time.
            </p>
            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I first started working in 2005 when I got hired at a pizza restuarant, and it was there that I learned how to make pizza from start to finish. After a couple of months
                there I had spent time working in several different positions, including making the dough and sauce for the restuarant. After working in food I had a short term in 
                retail working as a replenishment associate. I then started working in real estate as a broker's assistant before working my way up to team manager where I lead a team
                of agents and support personnel. I managed all the operations of the team from lead generation, contact relationship management, implementing automation and 
                telemarketing, and coordinating transactions to ensure proper data and file management. In 2017 I obtained my real estate salesperson license and continue to work in 
                that industry today. 
            </p>
            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>
                After completing my education in software engineering, I plan to search for and obtain a job as a software engineer where I can utilize the tools and abilities
                I've aquired during my education. I look forward to a long career in this industry and I am excited to continue my journey in this field. 
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>
                In my free time I enjoy relaxing at home, reading, watching tv shows and movies, playing video games, board games, and card games with friends and family. I also enjoy golfing,
                bowling, and playing pocket billiards (aka: pool). My favorite genre of entertainment is comedy, but I also enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and mystery dramas.
